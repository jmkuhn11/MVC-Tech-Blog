# MVC-Tech-Blog

## Description

I wanted to create an application that would allow for me and my fellow peers to communicate our ideas in a professional setting. I thus created a system that allowed users to make original posts, along with leaving comments under others' posts, all while keeping your personal ideas safe from edits/deletions through a login system. Through creating this tech blog, I gained a much better understanding of how to use handlebars, routes, and seed data on VSC. I also extensively worked on deploying the application on heroku, so there was a public link that worked for users on multiple systems. I hope to use this knowledge to be able to upload and deploy more advanced websites in the future for larger communities to use.

## Installation

One will need to use VSC, and make sure they use express, MySQL, and bcrypt to run the application on the local device during testing. If one is creating the application, they would also need to use heroku to make the link public for all to use.

## Usage

One will pull up the site on their browser and be taken to the homepage. They will then go to the login tab, where they can signup as a new user. Once their username and password is taken, they will go to their dashboard, which will not have any posts yet. They will have the oppurtunity to create new posts, along with edit or delete any they want to change. Once they have stated their thoughts, they can go back to the home page. There they can read other's thoughts and ideas. If they would like to speak with the original poster, they can view the post and leave a comment. Once completed, they may leave the site. When they return, they will just need to login with their username and password they used when signing up to start using the site from their account.
